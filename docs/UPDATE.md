# Update

For new firmware or hardware, you will need a new [factory image](https://github.com/crownstone/bluenet/blob/master/docs/FACTORY_IMAGES.md) to flash, this is described in the bluenet repository.

This may also require an update of the libraries, and the test itself. You will have to test and fix this yourself.
